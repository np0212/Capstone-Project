# Math Quizzes Project Description

## Goal
### _To create an educational web app for kindergarten through 12th grade students that allows their teachers to assign them math problems._

----


## Overview
* Each problem in the app's database will be tagged with both **keywords** and a **difficulty level** (Low, Medium, and High).
  * The instructor interface needs the ability to specify a number of problems a student should need to complete at each difficulty level in order to advance to the next level.
    * If an instructor decides that each student will answer, for example, 6 problems at the **Low** difficulty level
    * The web app will only allow a student to advance to the **Medium** difficulty level after correctly answering 6  **Low** level problems. 

* Instructors need a summary to view all students:
  * Results 
  * Results at each Difficulty level
  * Include a link to the actual problems

* _The client will provide the problems, tagged with the standard, difficulty level, and keyword(s)._
